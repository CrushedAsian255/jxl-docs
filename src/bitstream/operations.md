# Bitstream Operations

Thourghout this book, `read!(Operation)` means "read bitstream as specified in `Operation`".
`Operation` can be one of the following:

## `u(N)`

Read `N` bits as an integer. If `N == 0`, the result is zero.

## `U32(d0, d1, d2, d3)`

Returns unsigned 32-bit integer. Read an integer using the following pseudocode:

```
match read!(u(2)) {
    0 => read_u32!(d0),
    1 => read_u32!(d1),
    2 => read_u32!(d2),
    3 => read_u32!(d3),
}
```

Where `read_u32!` is defined as:

```
read_u32!(M)        := M as u32
read_u32!(u(N))     := read!(N) as u32
read_u32!(M + u(N)) := (M + read!(N)) as u32
```

## `Bool`

Returns boolean value. Equals to `read!(u(1)) != 0`.

## `U64`

Returns unsigned 64-bit integer. Read an integer using the following pseudocode:

```
match read!(u(2)) {
    0 => 0u64,
    1 => 1 + read!(u(4)) as u64,
    2 => 17 + read!(u(8)) as u64,
    3 => {
        let mut value = read!(u(12));
        let mut shift = 12;
        while read!(Bool) {
            if shift == 60 {
                value |= read!(u(4)) << shift;
                break;
            }
            value |= read!(u(8)) << shift;
            shift += 8;
        }
        value as u64
    }
}
```

For example, 0 is represented as two `0`s, and `u64::MAX` corresponds to 73 consecutive `1`s.

## `F16`

Equals to `f16::from_bits(read!(u(16)))`. Assert that the value is not `NaN` or infinities.

Note that you might need to convert bits to single precision float first, since most programming
languages don't have half precision float type.

## `struct Ty(value, ...)`

Read a struct, optionally with contexts; see [Structs and Enums](./struct-enum.md#structs).

## `enum Ty`

Read an enum; see [Structs and Enums](./struct-enum.md#enums).

## `ZeroPadToByte`

Read bits until it reaches byte boundary. Assert that bits are all zeroes.

## `read_vec!(Type, count)`

Read `count` of type `Type`
```
let mut output: Vec<Type> = Vec::new();
for _ in 0..count {
    output.push(read!(Type));
}
return output;
```
