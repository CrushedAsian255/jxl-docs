# LZ77 Stream

Entropy-coded streams can optionally be marked as [LZ77]-enabled.

```
let lz77_enabled = read!(Bool);
pub let lz77_config = if lz77_enabled {
    let config = read!(struct Lz77Params(num_dist));
    // NOTE: This mutates `num_dist`
    num_dist += 1;
    Some(config)
} else {
    None
};
```

Where `Lz77Params` is defined as:

```
struct Lz77Params(dist_ctx: u32) {
    pub let min_symbol = read!(U32(224, 512, 4096, 8 + u(15)));
    pub let min_length = read!(U32(3, 4, 5 + u(2), 9 + u(8)));
    pub let dist_ctx = dist_ctx;
    pub let len_conf = read!(struct HybridIntegerConfig(8));
}
```

... and `HybridIntegerConfig` is defined in [the corresponding subchapter](./hybrid-integer.md).

Now `lz77_config` contains whether LZ77 is enabled, and if so, parameters for handling LZ77 symbols.
Note that `num_dist` is increased by one if LZ77 is enabled. The last context is used to read LZ77
distance when LZ77 length symbol is encountered during decoding.
